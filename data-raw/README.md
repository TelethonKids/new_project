data-raw
================

Raw data (e.g. .xlsx, .csv, .sta, ...) files should be placed in this directory.

Data in this directory should be **read only**.

By default, all project data is ignored by _.gitignore_. No changes to raw 
data files should be made, with any modification made by R script with updates
saved elsewhere (i.e. the _data_ or _cache_ directories).
