New Project - basic branch
================

This repository contains a standardised template project directory that can be used to manage statistical/data science consultation projects. This approach provides a streamlined work-flow by removing repetitive administrative processes. A standardised work-flow also facilitates collaboration within cross-functional teams. This project structure is identical and successful for both simple and large-scale projects.

This basic branch is a simplified version of the more complete master branch.

Although this work-flow has been developed in R (based on the [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net) package), the broader principles discussed here are applicable to any scripting language and non-coding projects alike.

Each directory in this template project has a _README.md_ file that briefly describes its intended purpose. Further information about this template project structure can be found [here](https://telethonkids.wordpress.com/2019/07/24/how-do-you-organise-your-r-project-this-is-what-we-do/).

Further information about configuring automation _via._ ProjectTemplate can be found in <config/README.md>.
